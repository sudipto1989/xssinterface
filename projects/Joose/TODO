Features
- implement class versioning
- autodetect and use equivalents of methods in EvilObjectExtension.js of frameworks such as prototype.js, dojo and jquery.
- Add something to register Namespaces
- Make all builders accept strings instead of class objects, too, so you dont have to remember what to pass
- Implement auto loading of Joose.* classes

Refactoring:
- Remove Class("MyClass");has("bla");methods({}) - style syntax from Joose and test suite
- Implement Joose.Builders so that they dont clutter the top level name space

Done:
- Add an interface to Joose.Class to ask for instance vs. class methods
  - joose.isInstance
- execute every test file in its own iframe
- make this work in IE :)
